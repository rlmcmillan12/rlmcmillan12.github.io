# Me and Python

## Ryan McMillan

Over the first couple weeks of our bootcamp we worked exclusively with the programming language Python. While python has many uses it seems to me that there are a few uses that stand out from the rest. First of all Python is on of the more simple programming languages. It is great language for data storage and data analysis. It is also a great language for back end web development. It is used for communicating with and processing data for servers as well as URL processing. Python is also great for use in the automation of tasks such as reminders and renaming large sets of files.

Python has many advantages over its disadvantages. For that reason it is a widely used as one of the primary programming languages. The simplicity of Python is its biggest advantage. Its language is straightforward and easy for people to read. This makes Python a great language for beginners. The simplicity and data abilities also make it a great language for non programmers, such as scientists and bankers. The language is dynamic which means the data type is assigned while the code runs, and a type is not needed when the variable is assigned. It also makes it easy to change the data type of variables once assigned. Python also reads the code line by line so it is easy to debug. It is also an open source code, which means it free to use and always being improved by users.

There are some downsides to Python as well. It runs very slow compared to other languages, and it requires a lot of memory. This makes it a poor choice for mobile devices, and keeps its primary use to back end development. The dynamic capabilities of the code can also be a downside. The variables being to change data type can cause many runtime errors. The variable might have changed to a string when it is looking for an integer.

Overall python is a great language programming language for beginners and professionals. Its language is simple and it can be used for a large number of tasks. This is why it has become one of the main languages in programming
