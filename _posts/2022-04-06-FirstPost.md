Title: The very first one

# Welcome to My Blog

Now that the first couple of days of coding bootcamp have finished I’m feeling much more relaxed already. I haven’t been in school in over ten years, and I haven’t spent much time working on computers as well. It is nice to see that I am not the only one that is going into this with little or no experience. I was also worried I would get lost right from the start and not be able to catch up. So far I really like the pace and clarity of instruction. I’m excited to transition into an entirely new field of work, and all the potential opportunities it can bring.

At the end of the program I am hoping to be comfortable with being on a computer all day, familiar with the code languages and terminology, and getting self sufficient with development on my own. In six months it would be nice to be interviewing for jobs or landing land my first coding job. One year from now I hope to have a job and feel comfortable with my job, co-workers, and daily work routine.

I’m hoping that this program will be a life changing opportunity for my family as long as myself. I’m hoping to score a job with better pay and benefits than I previously had, be able to provide more for my family, and I would like to get a job where I can work from home. I know there will be difficulties and trials throughout the course, but I’m not sure exactly what and when they will be. I’m so unfamiliar with the world of coding it all seems so unpredictable to me. I will try to lean on the resources provided through the modules, the instructors, some hard work, and a lot of googling to get through the program. The thought that will keep me going is how 16 weeks of long school days seems like a very short amount of time compared to the impact it can have on our lives/ careers.
